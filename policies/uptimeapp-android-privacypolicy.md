The app is a free Android app developed by Jaakko J. The app is available for free on Google Play Store.

I personally take privacy very seriously and thus hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All app data data (such as (but not limited to) the recorded uptimes and achievements, or app settings (accent color, theme, etc.)) created by you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be erased by simply clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

### Third party libraries

As an Android app released through Google Play, some usage related data is automatically collected to provide me insights such as (but not limited to)
- number of users in different countries
- number of users on different versions of the app
- crash reports with stack traces
